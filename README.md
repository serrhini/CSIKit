## Description

**CSIKit** is a framework aimed at assisting data scientists, researchers, and programmers with performing experiments and tests using CSI-capable WiFi hardware.

While the various public extraction toolkits do include scripts for parsing CSI data from their specific formats, these are largely written for MATLAB. Given the increasing focus on using deep learning in CSI experimentation, Python tools for parsing and processing CSI data may be more desirable for some. This is aimed at improving the accessibility of CSI research for those who may be interested in the area but have little experience with network engineering.

As is usually the case with research-oriented software, documentation is in-progress.

CSIKit provides a command line tool for parsing, processing, converting, and visualisation of CSI data, as well as libraries for use in other Python applications such as those working with Tensorflow, PyTorch, etc.

```console
csikit [OPTIONS] file[.pcap/.dat]
```

## Installation

CSIKit can be installed via pip or used directly from source.

```console
pip install csikit
```

## Example

### Command Line

```console
csikit log.all_csi.6.7.6.dat
csikit --graph --graph-type all_subcarriers log.all_csi.6.7.6.dat
csikit --csv log.all_csi.6.7.6.dat
```

### CSIKit library

Generic example:

```python
from CSIKit.reader import get_reader

my_reader = get_reader("path/to/csi_file.dat/pcap")
csi_data = my_reader.read_file("path/to/my_csi_file.dat/pcap")
```

<!-- Raspberry Pi 4 example:

```python
from CSIKit.reader import NEXBeamformReader

my_reader = NEXBeamformReader()
csi_data = my_reader.read_file("path/to/test.pcap")
``` -->

Hardware-specific (Intel IWL5300) example:

```python
from CSIKit.reader import IWLBeamformReader

my_reader = IWLBeamformReader()
csi_data = my_reader.read_file("path/to/log.all_csi.6.7.6.dat")
```

## Library

CSIKit exposes key components for use in other Python applications: `Reader` and `csitools`. As other sections of code become more refined, this will likely grow over time.

Note: This documentation is initial and brief. More will follow shortly.

A Reader is used to read a given CSI capture file and generate parsed traces and matrices. As each file format differs a significant amount, different readers are necessary for each piece of hardware. Using the `get_reader` method in `CSIKit.reader`, the correct reader can be automatically selected for a given file. Optionally, hardware-specific readers can be imported, as `ATHBeamformReader`, `IWLBeamformReader`, and `NEXBeamformReader`.

Once instantiated, a Reader can be used to read a file using the `read_file` method. This method returns a `CSIData` object, which contain frames (`CSIFrame` objects), timestamps, and metadata from parsing (errors, device information, etc). Additional parsing options can be passed to `read_file`, including `scaled` (bool) to rescale CSI values from manufacturer's internal scaling.

`CSIFrame`s will have a different type, based on the type of Reader used to parse them. All `CSIFrame`s contain a `csi_matrix` (being the most significant part of the payload), however they also contain additional attributes for each frame. Some attributes may be common across the different frame types, however they can vary significantly from one type to another. Next steps for this library are aimed at further integrating these standards. The full list of attributes associated with each frame are listed below.

## Using CSI Matrices

CSI matrices contain complex numbers representing the gain and phase of a signal at a given subcarrier. These are output in their complex form in `CSIFrame`s, however `csitools` contains a function for retrieving CSI amplitude from them.

```python
from CSIKit.reader import get_reader
from CSIKit.util import csitools

my_reader = get_reader("path/to/file.pcap")
csi_data = my_reader.read_file("path/to/file.pcap", scaled=True)
csi_matrix, no_frames, no_subcarriers = csitools.get_CSI(csi_data)
```

The returned tuple contains a modified matrix which contains CSI amplitudes in dBm, followed by the number of frames and subcarriers represented therein.

Once we have CSI amplitude data, we can also apply filters for preprocessing (as seen in many publications making use of CSI).

```python
from CSIKit.reader.filters import lowpass, hampel, running_mean
from CSIKit.reader import get_reader
from CSIKit.util import csitools

my_reader = get_reader("path/to/file.pcap")
csi_data = my_reader.read_file("path/to/file.pcap", scaled=True)
csi_matrix, no_frames, no_subcarriers = csitools.get_CSI(csi_data, metric="amplitude", squeeze_output=True)
csi_matrix_trans = np.transpose(csi_matrix)

#This example assumes CSI data is sampled at ~100Hz.
#In this example, we apply (sequentially):
#  - a lowpass filter to isolate frequencies below 10Hz (order = 5)
#  - a hampel filter to reduce high frequency noise (window size = 10, significance = 3)
#  - a running mean filter for smoothing (window size = 10)

for x in no_frames:
  csi_matrix_trans[x] = lowpass(csi_matrix_trans[x], 10, 100, 5)
  csi_matrix_trans[x] = hampel(csi_matrix_trans[x], 10, 3)
  csi_matrix_trans[x] = running_mean(csi_matrix_trans[x], 10)
```

## Mistakes and Tests

If anything is wrong, [let me know](mailto:g.r.forbes@rgu.ac.uk). I want to know why, and fix it!

I'm a PhD student working on several sensor data-focussed experiments, a few of which involve using CSI. I'm am by no means an RF engineer or particularly experienced this area. I have done and are doing as much as I can to make sure that anything produced with this is accurate. To that end, there are MATLAB .mat files included in the `tests` folder which have been generated using IWLBeamformReader, NEXBeamformReader, and scipy's `savemat` method. There are also MATLAB scripts in the `scripts` folder which can be used to check the validity of the output from this tool. In my experience I have found these tools to produce identical output to the MATLAB scripts offered by the following developers. If this is not the case, let me know.

Further to that, if there are any assertions I have made within code comments or otherwise which are factually incorrect, again let me know. I want to learn as much about this area as I reasonably can.
